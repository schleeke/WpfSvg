# WPFSVG
A small tool for converting scalable vector graphics to XAML *DrawingImage*s.  
The tool is a fork of [SvgToXaml](https://github.com/BerndK/SvgToXaml) by [BerndK](https://github.com/BerndK).  
I used all the conversion stuff from it - everything that is beneath the *SvgConverter* directory is mostly simply a 1:1 copy.  
I created/forked it so that the GUI would fit my needs more than the original one.

## How to use
Navigate to the directory of your choice and double click an SVG image on the right side to copy its *\<DrawingImage>* representation to the clipboard.
